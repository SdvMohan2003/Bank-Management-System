🔧 Technical Implementation
Core Classes
Account.java (Base Class)

Abstract base class for all account types
Manages common account properties (number, holder, balance)
Provides fundamental banking operations (deposit, withdraw)
Implements account details display functionality

SavingsAccount.java (Derived Class)

Extends Account class with interest rate functionality
Calculates and displays interest earnings
Specialized savings account operations
Interest rate management and computation

Bank.java (Service Layer)

Manages multiple accounts and banking operations
Handles account creation and retrieval
Processes transactions across different account types
Provides banking system coordination

BankingSystem.java (Main Application)

User interface and menu system
Application entry point and flow control
Interactive console-based operations
User input handling and validation

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or command line tools

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/SdvMohan2003/BankManagementSystem.git
cd BankManagementSystem

Compile the project:
bashjavac -d out src/BMS/*.java

Run the application:
bashjava -cp out BMS.BankingSystem


Alternative IDE Setup

Import the project into your preferred Java IDE
Ensure the src folder is marked as the source root

💻 Usage Examples
Creating a Savings Account
java// Example of creating a savings account with 3.5% interest rate
SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount("SA001", "John Doe", 1000.0, 3.5);
Processing Transactions
java// Deposit money
account.deposit(500.0);

// Withdraw money
account.withdraw(200.0);

// Check balance
double balance = account.getBalance();
Account Information
java// Display detailed account information
account.showAccountDetails();
🔒 Security Features

Balance Validation: Prevents overdrafts and negative transactions
Input Sanitization: Validates user inputs for secure operations
Transaction Logging: Maintains transaction history and account state
Error Handling: Comprehensive exception handling for robust operation

🛠️ Technical Highlights
Object-Oriented Design Principles

Inheritance: Account hierarchy with specialized account types
Encapsulation: Private data members with controlled access
Polymorphism: Method overriding for account-specific operations
Abstraction: Clean interfaces hiding implementation complexity

Design Patterns Used

Factory Pattern: Account creation and management
Template Method: Common banking operations structure
Strategy Pattern: Different account type behaviors

📊 System Workflow

System Initialization: Load banking system and initialize components
Account Management: Create and manage different account types
Transaction Processing: Handle deposits, withdrawals, and inquiries
Balance Management: Real-time balance updates and validation
Reporting: Generate account statements and transaction summaries
